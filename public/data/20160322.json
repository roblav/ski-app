Great cover across the main pistes top to middle. The lower slopes are closed as they are thin and narrow. There is still a good route back to car park level for intermediates and experts from the top of Coire Cas using the Fiacaill traverse, Fiacaill side slope, and lower fiacaill piste. Light winds forecast tomorrow rising slightly by late afternoon. Snow showers moving in by evening with a temperature of -2C. Forecast is now colder weather with a return to winter and snow fall into Easter weekend and start of next week. We have great cover top to middle, so its shaping up nicely for the Easter holidays.Tomorrow's scheduled uplift is the M1 Poma, West Wall Poma, Cas tow, Ciste tow, Ptarmigan tow, Polar Express and Funicular Railway opening from 9:30am.
