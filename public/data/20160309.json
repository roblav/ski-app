There will be a shuttle bus operating from the Ciste car park. First lifts at 9.00 AM. We will not operate the Ptarmigan T bar tomorrow morning. This is to allow us to finish building the Park for this weekend's Scottish Freestyle Championships. The new 'new' motor was changed out on the M1 and this was back up and running this afternoon.\nGet up here if you can with your sunnies and factor 100. \nHope you can make it"},{"status":"Snow Level: \nThere is snow from the car park level upwards."},{"status":"Vertical Runs: \n500 metres."}],"mountainLifts":[{"lift":"Funicular Railway","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"Car Park T Bar","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"Fiacaill Ridge Poma","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"Sunkid Megastar","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"Coire Cas T Bar","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"Coire na Ciste T Bar","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"M1 Poma","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"Polar Express Poma","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"Ptarmigan T Bar","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"West Wall Poma","lift--status":"opening"},{"lift":"Day Lodge Poma","lift--status":"opening"}],"mountainRuns":[{"run":"Half Pipe","run--status":"closed"},{"run":"Ptarmigan Bowl","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Terrain Park","run--status":"closed"},{"run":"Ciste Fairway","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Ciste Bowl","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Traverse","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Coire Cas","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Cas Shred","run--status":"on hold"},{"run":"105","run--status":"open"},{"run":"ZigZags","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Gun Barrel","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Chicken Gully","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Fiacaill Piste","run--status":"open"},{"run":"M1","run--status":"open"},{"run":"M1 105 Link","run--status":"open"},{"run":"White Lady","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Sheiling","run--status":"open"},{"run":"The Sheiling Shred","run--status":"closed"},{"run":"Cottam's Way","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Burnside","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Home Road","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Car Park","run--status":"open"},{"run":"Fiacaill Ridge","run--status":"open"},{"run":"M2","run--status":"opening"},{"run":"Ciste Gully","run--status":"opening"},{"run":"West Wall","run--status":"closed"},{"run":"Ryvoan","run--status":"opening"},{"run":"Aonach Bowl","run--status":"opening"},{"run":"East Wall No 1 Gully","run--status":"opening"},{"run":"East Wall No 2 Gully","run--status":"closed"},{"run":"Over Yonder","run--status":"opening"},{"run":"Day Lodge","run--status":"opening"}]}}
