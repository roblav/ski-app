Due to high winds and drifting snow the upper mountain was closed for snow sports. We had snow sports using train from the middle station with the pistes open on the lower slopes. Conditions on the lower slopes were mixed with some areas catching fresh snow and other areas being stripped in the wind. Tomorrow's forecast is for the same strength of winds as today with gusts around 65 mph on the summit. With the temperature rising to 0C at 6am in the morning then dropping back to -6C by late afternoon. Sleet soon turning back to snow in the morning. The wind direction is westerly which may shelter the lowest lifts. We have some more electrical work by SSE on the mountain and in Glenmore forest tonight, (after the storm damage 3 weeks ago) this could potentially delay our morning updates but we will aim to get the latest info out at 7:30am.
