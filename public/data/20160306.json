"Operations Update: 5.30 PM Update 6th March. A day of mixed and variable visibility today, however the snow was mostly in great condition. The Ciste Gully opened late morning. Tomorrow looks like it could be the day of the week with long periods of sunshine forecast, so get here if you can. All uplift and all main runs are scheduled to open with first lifts from 9.00 AM. There will be a shuttle bus operating from the Ciste Car Park. For the more advanced riders there are various routes back to the Ciste Car Park, however these are not patrolled and unmarked and should only be attempted in good visibility and with people who know the routes. Thanks for coming and we hope you can make it tomorrow. Ops 1"
"Snow Level: There is snow from the car park level upwards."
"Vertical Runs: 500 metres."
