Stunning day with wall to wall sunshine and no wind. Pistes softening in the sunshine leaving spring snow conditions on a hard base. The Ciste side was firm all day in the shade. With a settled high pressure forecast continuing for the next 8 days there is going to be some superb mid week snowsports with the White Lady in fantastic condition. Still great conditions top to middle. It is still possible to ski back to the Base Station using the car park run. Cas Shred and 2 Jumps and features in the Ptarmigan bowl are Open. Come on up again tomorrow for some mountain air, sunshine and lovely snow.
